					<span>This one is simple. “Be excellent to each other.” Don’t shit talk other people’s plays. If someone finds your language offensive, be considerate, do the adult thing, and save it for your buddies.</span>

				<span class="c7">PLAY WHAT YOU LOVE</span>
			</h2>
			<p>
				<span>Yeah, We’re called Pop Punk/Rock/Alternative/Emo, but we’re still a “</span><span>play anything</span><span class="c3">” room. We just happen to love those genres the most. Queue up what you love most and share it with us. We’re always looking for something new and great.</span>

			<p class="c0">
				<span class="c3">Since we allow pretty much everything, we want people to feel confident in trying something new. Downvoting can shy people away from sharing something new, something amazing.</span>

				<span class="c3">Save it for one of the indie rooms, they love that shit.</span>

			</h2>
			<p>
				Sure, but follow the room rules first. Talk to the mods, maybe we could even have a listening party in your honor. Just don’t come in acting like you rule the place demanding your music be played. It’s just not going to be a good time for anyone, even if your music is cool. If you have any questions, read rule 1 again.
